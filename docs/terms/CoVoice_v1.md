# Term: CoVoice

- **Human name:** CoVoice
- **Type:** Practice / doctrine / workflow pattern
- **Family:** CoStyle · CoPermanence · CoPingPong · CoSurfing

## Short definition

CoVoice is the intentional practice of preserving the original human voice, spirit, and narrative flavor in any asset that is being repackaged, evolved, or integrated into a repository or source of truth.

## Purpose

- Keep human context and personal nuance intact while assets are adapted to new formats or uses.
- Avoid “AI-flattened” outputs that erase the author’s tone, history, or emotional stakes.
- Give both humans and AIs a named pattern for when and how to respect the origin voice during edits.

## When to apply

Use CoVoice when:

- Refactoring a long-form narrative (README, doctrine, essay, memo) into a new structure.
- Converting chats, transcripts, or raw notes into keeper assets.
- Migrating content between repos (for example, from a private draft into CoCivium, CoSteward, or CoRef).
- Translating or summarizing materials that are strongly associated with a particular person or community.

## How to apply

When you are editing under CoVoice:

1. **Name the voice.**  
   Capture who this asset “belongs to” in spirit (for example, Rick, a specific contributor, a community voice).

2. **Preserve narrative flavor.**  
   - Keep characteristic turns of phrase where they aid meaning.  
   - Fix clarity, repetition, and structure, but do not sand away all quirks.

3. **Mark heavy edits.**  
   If you have to rewrite whole sections for clarity or safety, note that in the commit message and, when helpful, in the doc header.

4. **Avoid over-normalising.**  
   - Prefer simple punctuation and readable sentences.  
   - Do not remove all humour, doubt, or emotion just to sound “professional”.

5. **Document CoVoice decisions.**  
   When in doubt, add a short note like: “Edited under CoVoice; original tone preserved where safe and clear.”

## Relation to other terms

- **CoStyle:** CoVoice is a guardrail inside CoStyle. CoStyle defines house style; CoVoice protects personal style inside it.
- **CoPermanence:** CoVoice decisions should be especially respected once an asset becomes permanent (merged to main, published, or referenced).
- **CoSurfing / CoWaves / MegaWaves:** During rapid evolutions, CoVoice helps decide what must be kept from earlier drafts instead of being overwritten by the latest AI pass.

## Gibber (placeholder)

- `cov.voice.core` – tag for assets edited under CoVoice discipline.
- `cov.voice.priority.high` – use when preserving voice is critical to trust or meaning.

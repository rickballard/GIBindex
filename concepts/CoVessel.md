# CoVessel

**Definition**  
A CoVessel is a movable conceptual container for clusters of CoTerms, CoPatterns, or CoConcepts that must *travel together* across repos, CodeBlocks, narratives, and MegaWaves.

Where:
- **CoTree** = hierarchy
- **CoRoots** = ontology
- **CoMap** = navigation
- **CoBeacon** = direction
- **CoBreak** = constraint-defense
- **CoVessel** = transport-layer for idea clusters

**Purpose**
- Package evolving ideas into transferable “concept packs”
- Allow cross-repo propagation
- Support session-to-session evolution
- Provide a backbone for Gibber-language indexing

**Examples**
- CoVessel: AI-Leadership Modes
- CoVessel: CoEvo Theory Sweep Atoms
- CoVessel: Contributor Skill Bundles

# CoGo

**Definition**  
CoGo is a handover signal meaning: *"AI leads now."*  
It grants the AI initiative to choose:
- the next action
- the next term
- the next repo
- the next MegaWave
- the next conceptual expansion

**Modes enabled**
- CoBurst
- CoSteer
- CoOverride
- CoAnchor
- CoDiffuse

CoGo is an *AI-leadership switch*, not a concept module.
